  - `feature` ‚Üí Adding new resources, tools, or sections  
  - `fix` ‚Üí Bug fixes, broken links, or corrections  
  - `chore` ‚Üí Maintenance tasks (CI/CD, configs, cleanup)  

- **`<short-description>`** ‚Üí A brief, lowercase, hyphenated description of the branch‚Äôs purpose  

**Examples:**  
- `feature/add-auto-gpt-resource`  
- `fix/update-paper-link`
